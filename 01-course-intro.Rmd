## What is this course about? {-}

- What is behavior?
- How is human behavior similar to/different from other animals?
- What are the *neurological* bases (of human behavior)?
- What other bases (of human behavior) are there?
- How do the neurological bases of human behavior affect your life?

---

- Why does taking/drinking X make me feel Y?
- My grandmother has Alzheimer's disease. What's happening to her brain?
- Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder. What's that about?
- Why is sleep so important for brain health?
- My mom says my frontal cortex isn't fully mature. Is she right?
- Is it safe for high school athletes to play football (or soccer, hockey, etc.)?

## Keys for success {-}

- Study the figures.
- Study regularly -- don't cram.
- Come to class.
- Participate!

## Why is biology essential for the science of behavior? {-}

- What is science?
    - What distinguishes sciences?
    - What is neuroscience?
- Why is neuroscience harder than physics?

### What is [science](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science)? {-}

- Body of facts or truths
- Process of acquiring knowledge
    - Systematic study
    - Observation, experiment, description
    - Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws
    - *Strives* for objectivity
 
### Gilmore on science vs. other ways of thinking {-}

- Science is a *way of thinking* and a *set of behaviors*
- Science *describes*, tries to *predict*
- Science alone not well-suited to *prescribing* (recommending) or *proscribing* (prohibiting)
    - little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc.
    - (Although systematic descriptions of phenomena can be used to make pre/proscriptive claims...)
- Science rests on **evidence and logic** 
    - <span class="blue">NOT on authorities</span> (e.g., people whose stature is largely or solely based on their position or economic status)
    - However, some scientific claims (and scientists) are more credible and authoritative than others.
- Science respects tradition
    - but questions and tests it repeatedly...
- Science should be reproducible
    - others can get the same answer
- Science
    + has led to huge advances in human health and prosperity over the last several centuries
    + will be essential for maintaining and extending those advances in the future
    + Example: Rapid development and deployment of multiple, effective, and safe vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 that sharply reduce severe illness and death.

### Similarities among sciences {-}

- What are the different kinds of X?
    - **Form**, e.g., anatomy
- How does X work?
    - **Function**, e.g., physiology
- Where did X come from?
    - **Origins**, e.g., development/evolution
    
### Examples {-}

- "Coronavirus gets its name because of its crown-like shape."
- "Viruses reproduce (and cause illness) by forcing host organisms to create massive quantities of the virus that then spread to others."
- "Coronavirus appears to have originated in non-human animals in China."

```

### Differences among sciences {-}

- Phenomena of interest (studying *what*)
- Methods or tools (studying it *how*)
- At what *level(s) of analysis*
    - Spatial scale (nanometers $10^{-9}m$ to light-years $10^{15}m$)
    - Temporal scale (milliseconds $10^{-3}s$ to millenia $10^3s$)
    
## What is neuroscience? {-}

- The study of the nervous system
    - And the behavior it makes possible
- Questions neuroscience asks...
    - What are the parts of the nervous system?
    - How do the parts work?  What do they do?
    - Where did they come from?
