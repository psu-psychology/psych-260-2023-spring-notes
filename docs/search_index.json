What is behavior? How is human behavior similar to/different from other animals? What are the neurological bases (of human) behavior? What other bases (of human behavior) are there? How do the neurological bases of human behavior affect your life? Why does taking/drinking X make me feel Y? My grandmother has Alzheimer’s disease. What’s happening to her brain? Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder. What’s that about? Why is sleep so important for brain health? My mom says my frontal cortex isn’t fully mature. Is she right?

Study regularly – don’t cram. Come to class. Participate! Why is biology essential for the science of behavior? What is science? What distinguishes sciences? What is neuroscience? Why is neuroscience harder than physics? What is science? Body of facts or truths Process of acquiring knowledge Systematic study Observation, experiment, description Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws Strives for objectivity Science vs. other ways of thinking Science is a way of thinking and a set of behaviors Scientists strive toward communal norms (Merton 1979): communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism. Science describes, tries to predict Science alone not well-suited to prescribing (recommending) or proscribing (prohibiting) little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc. (Although systematic descriptions of phenomena can be used to make pre/proscriptive claims…) Science rests on evidence and logic NOT on authorities (e.g., people whose stature is largely or solely based on their position or economic status) However, some scientific claims (and scientists) are more credible and authoritative than others. Science respects tradition but not uncritically questions and tests it repeatedly… Science should be reproducible, robust, transparent others can get the same answer, but see PSYCH 490.003 Science led to huge advances in human health &amp; prosperity essential for maintaining &amp; extending those advances Example: Rapid development and deployment of multiple, effective, and safe vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 that sharply reduce severe illness and death. Similarities among sciences What are the different kinds of X? Form, e.g., anatomy How does X work? Function, e.g., physiology Where did X come from? Origins, e.g., development/evolution Examples “Coronavirus gets its name because of its crown-like shape.” “Viruses reproduce (and cause illness) by forcing host organisms to create massive quantities of the virus that then spread to others.” “Coronavirus appears to have originated in non-human animals in China.” An example of scientific perspectives on origins… Figure 1.14: https://www.evogeneao.com Differences among sciences Phenomena of interest (studying what) Methods or tools (studying it how) At what level(s) of analysis Spatial scale (nanometers \\(10^{-9}m\\) to light-years \\(10^{15}m\\)) Temporal scale (milliseconds \\(10^{-3}s\\) to millenia \\(10^3s\\)) What is neuroscience? The study of the nervous system And the behavior it makes possible Questions neuroscience asks… What are the parts of the nervous system? How do the parts work? What do they do? Where did they come from? Spatial and temporal scales in neuroscience Figure 1.15: (Sejnowski, Churchland, and Movshon 2014) Why neuroscience is harder than physics References "],["systems.html", "Topic 2 Systems Related ideas Non-biological examples Systems have May be thought of as networks Why is studying systems so hard?", " Topic 2 Systems Figure 2.1: https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/fashion-smart_casual-dress_code-dress_code-protest-fashion_statement-sbln385_low.jpg Neuroscience studies the nervous system… But what are systems?

Single parts -&gt; multiple functions Single functions -&gt; multiple parts Change structure/function over time (learning, development, evolution) == are dynamic Naturally occurring systems not “designed” like human-engineered ones What is being exchanged/processed? Answer (often): Information What is being controlled? Take your own example system from earlier. What are the components of that system? What are the inputs and outputs?

Pineal gland Figure 3.13: Figure of the pineal gland by Descartes: http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/descartes-pineal-gland-granger.jpg Do you agree with Descartes? Yes, human minds are fundamentally different from animal minds. The human mind is influenced by both physical and extraphysical processes. No, human minds are similar to animal minds. The human mind arises solely from physical processes. How would you scientifically test Descartes idea about the role of the pineal gland?
