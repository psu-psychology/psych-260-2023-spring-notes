What is behavior? How is human behavior similar to/different from other animals? What are the neurological bases (of human) behavior? What other bases (of human behavior) are there? How do the neurological bases of human behavior affect your life? Why does taking/drinking X make me feel Y? My grandmother has Alzheimer’s disease. What’s happening to her brain? Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder. What’s that about? Why is sleep so important for brain health? My mom says my frontal cortex isn’t fully mature. Is she right?

Study regularly – don’t cram. Come to class. Participate! Why is biology essential for the science of behavior? What is science? What distinguishes sciences? What is neuroscience? Why is neuroscience harder than physics? What is science? Body of facts or truths Process of acquiring knowledge Systematic study Observation, experiment, description Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws Strives for objectivity Science vs. other ways of thinking Science is a way of thinking and a set of behaviors Scientists strive toward communal norms (Merton 1979): communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism. Science describes, tries to predict Science alone not well-suited to prescribing (recommending) or proscribing (prohibiting) little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc. (Although systematic descriptions of phenomena can be used to make pre/proscriptive claims…) Science rests on evidence and logic NOT on authorities (e.g., people whose stature is largely or solely based on their position or economic status) However, some scientific claims (and scientists) are more credible and authoritative than others. Science respects tradition but not uncritically questions and tests it repeatedly… Science should be reproducible, robust, transparent others can get the same answer, but see PSYCH 490.003 Science led to huge advances in human health &amp; prosperity essential for maintaining &amp; extending those advances Example: Rapid development and deployment of multiple, effective, and safe vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 that sharply reduce severe illness and death. Similarities among sciences What are the different kinds of X? Form, e.g., anatomy How does X work? Function, e.g., physiology Where did X come from? Origins, e.g., development/evolution Examples “Coronavirus gets its name because of its crown-like shape.” “Viruses reproduce (and cause illness) by forcing host organisms to create massive quantities of the virus that then spread to others.” “Coronavirus appears to have originated in non-human animals in China.” An example of scientific perspectives on origins… Figure 1.14: https://www.evogeneao.com Differences among sciences Phenomena of interest (studying what) Methods or tools (studying it how) At what level(s) of analysis Spatial scale (nanometers \\(10^{-9}m\\) to light-years \\(10^{15}m\\)) Temporal scale (milliseconds \\(10^{-3}s\\) to millenia \\(10^3s\\)) What is neuroscience? The study of the nervous system And the behavior it makes possible Questions neuroscience asks… What are the parts of the nervous system? How do the parts work? What do they do? Where did they come from? Spatial and temporal scales in neuroscience Figure 1.15: (Sejnowski, Churchland, and Movshon 2014) Why neuroscience is harder than physics References "],["systems.html", "Topic 2 Systems Related ideas Non-biological examples Systems have May be thought of as networks Why is studying systems so hard?

Pineal gland Figure 3.13: Figure of the pineal gland by Descartes: http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/descartes-pineal-gland-granger.jpg Do you agree with Descartes? Yes, human minds are fundamentally different from animal minds. The human mind is influenced by both physical and extraphysical processes. No, human minds are similar to animal minds. The human mind arises solely from physical processes. How would you scientifically test Descartes idea about the role of the pineal gland?

Some good examples of systems ““An example of a system can be a bus system found on the Penn State campus. There are different buses within the system that transport individuals to different areas via various routes. There can be many other components involved in the bus system such as: the bus drivers, how many stops there are on each route, the funding for maintenance of the buses, how the routes are determined, and the maximum capacity of the buses. the inputs of the system are the students at their original location, and the outputs of the system are the students at their desired location.” ““A vending machine is a system used to dispense food after a payment has been given… The input of the system includes the form of payment, whether it be in bills or coins, and the location of the food/drink as given by the push of a button. The outputs of the system are the change given back and the food/drink that is dispensed.” “For the muscular system, the inputs would be the ability to contract the muscles and the individual components of the thick and thin filaments working in conjunction to create this motion. In addition to the inputs that act on and make the muscle contract, the output would be the action of the muscle and its function/what it performs.” “Toasters would be categorized as an open system because they freely exchange energy and matter with their surroundings. The input would be electrical energy from whatever outlet it is plugged into, the mechanical energy used to press the lever downwards and start the cooking, as well as the untoasted piece of bread you place into it. The output would be the result of the electrical energy transferred into heat which then toasts the bread, so we have thermal energy and a now-toasted piece of bread.” “A subway system can be defined as an electric railway that operates underground. The components of this system include an area of land underground, train tracks, train, cars, and subway stations. These components include seats within train cars, electrical wires along the tracks and throughout the subway tunnels, ticket booths within the subway station, etc.” “The input for [a subway system] is power supplied to the train cars through electricity from wires or an electrified rail. The output is the movement of the trains. Once the electricity is received by the train car, it can begin moving in order to fulfill its purpose of moving people from one place to another throughout the area in which it operates.” “Some components of the digestive system include the mouth, the stomach, the small and large intestine, and the colon. The inputs are the food and drink that we put into our bodies to gain nutrients for energy to use… The output is urination and defecation.” Back to lecture notes 2023-02-02 Figure 9.3: Neuronal migration from (bbscottvids 2009) Figure 9.4: EyeWire.org: (“How to Play EyeWire,” n.d.) 2023-02-06 Propagation is the way… Figure 9.5: Superstition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_tmeHCO1IM The neuron’s resting potential is approximately what voltage? +50mV 0mV -70mV If only potassium ions \\(K^+\\) and organic anions \\(A^-\\) were in a neuron, what would the voltage across the neuron (its membrane potential) be? -90mV, the equilibrium potential for \\(K^+\\). +55mv, the equilibrium potential for \\(Na^+\\). 0mv, the equilibrium potential for solutions with equal concentrations of + and - ions.
