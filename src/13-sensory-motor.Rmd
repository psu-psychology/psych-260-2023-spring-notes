```

#### Smartphone design goals {-}

- Why do they need to know it? In what context, for what purpose?
- What types of information does your device need to gather, through which channels?

#### Smartphone sensors {-}

- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Proximity sensor
- Ambient light sensor
- Barometer
- Thermometer
- Mic
- Camera

### My turn... {-}

- What information do **I** need to acquire? 
- Why do **I** need to know it? In what context & for what purpose?
- What types of information do **I** need to gather, through which channels?

### Dimensions of sensory processing {-}

- *Interoceptive*
    + How am I?
- *Exteroceptive*
    + What's in the world, where is it?
    
#### Questions for interoception: How are you? {-}

- Tired or rested?
- Well or ill?
- Hungry or thirsty or sated?
- Stressed vs. coping?
- Emotional state?
- Where am I?

#### Questions for exteroception {-}

- Who/What is out there?
- Where is it?

### Mrs. Potraz was wrong...there aren't 5 senses {-}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/biopsych-table-8.1.jpg")
```

- More than 5 senses!

#### How sensory channels differ {-}

- What is the energy/chemical source?
- How does the channel inform...
    + What's there?
    + Where's it located or moving?

## Somatosensation {-}

- Sensations about the body

### Types of somatosensation {-}

- Internal (interoceptive)
    + Where/how is my body positioned?  How do I feel?
    + Proprioception (perception of the self)
- External (exteroceptive)
    + What’s in the world?
    + Where is it?

### Internal senses {-}

- Kinesthesia
    + Body position
    + Movement 
- Pain
- Vestibular sense
    + Head position (relative to gravity)
    + Head movement (rotation, translation)
    
#### Vesibulo-ocular response (VOR) {-}

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Vestibulo-ocular response (VOR): https://www.mcgill.ca/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/files/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/images/222_0.gif"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mcgill.ca/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/files/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/images/222_0.gif")
```

- Keeps eyes steady when head moves

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="[@Castilla2007-cq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_R0LcPnZ_w)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_R0LcPnZ_w")
```

- Can't walk & text without it

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="[@Top_Tens_World2017-gn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynvd70b-uCY)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynvd70b-uCY")
```
    
### External senses {-}

- What's out there and where is it located?
- Cutaneous (receptors in the skin) senses
    + Hot, cold
    + Pressure
    + Vibration
- Plus kinesthesia (why?)

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/cuteneous-receptors.jpg")
```

- Receptors specialize in different info types, properties

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/pacinian-meissner.jpg")
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/merkel-ruffini.jpg")
```

### Combined thermo (heat/cold) and chemo-receptors {-}

- Taste dimension -> chemo receptor ≠ temperature dimension
- Why are minty foods cool?
- Why are spicy foods hot?
- Receptors that sense chemicals AND temperature

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/menthol-vanilloid-receptors.jpg")
```

- Menthol/mint receptor (CMR1)
    + Also signals "cool" temperatures
- Vanilloid Receptors (TrpV1/VR1, VRL1)
    + Respond to capsaicin (in peppers), allyl isothiocyanate (in mustard, wasabi)
    + Also signal "hot" temperatures
    
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Scoville heat scale: https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scoville-Heat-Scale-Savory-Experiments2.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scoville-Heat-Scale-Savory-Experiments2.jpg")
```
    
### Size/speed trade-off {-}

- Not all info travels at the same speed
- Thicker axons -> faster
- Myelinated axons -> faster

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/axon-size-speed-tradeoff.jpg")
```

- Kinesthesia (from muscles and joints) the fastest
- Pain/itch slow

### From skin to brain {-}

- Cutaneous receptors ->
- Dorsal root ganglion in spinal cord ->
- Ventral posterior lateral thalamus ->
- Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) ->
    + Post-central gyrus of parietal lobe
    
#### Dermatomes {-}

- Patches of skin ennervated by a set of nerves

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/skin-to-spinal-cord.jpg")
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/dermatomes.jpg")
```
    
#### Functional segregation in spinal cord {-}

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="http://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Overview-of-the-Dorsal-Column-Medial-Lemniscal-Pathway-1.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Overview-of-the-Dorsal-Column-Medial-Lemniscal-Pathway-1.jpg")
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="http://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/The-Spinothalamic-Tracts-Ascending-Sensory-1.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/The-Spinothalamic-Tracts-Ascending-Sensory-1.jpg")
```

- Separate pathways for different information types
- Dorsal column/medial leminiscal pathway
    - Touch, proprioception
- Spinothalamic tract
    - Pain, temperature

#### Somatatopic maps in thalamus & cerebral cortex {-}

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/s1.jpg")
```

- Some areas of skin activate disproportionately size areas of the cerebral cortex

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Somatosensory homunculus"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/homunculus.jpg")
```

- Smallest discriminable distance between two-points (two-point threshold) varies

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/two-point-thresholds.jpg")
```

- Occupational Therapists (OTs) measure this

```{r, fig.cap="[@OTGeddie2017-hf]()"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX35WDJohFo")
```

- S1 maintains functional segregation of input types

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/s1-columns.jpg")
```

### Phantom Limbs {-}

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="[@Cogmonaut2010-el](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mHIv5ToMTM)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mHIv5ToMTM")
```

###  Summing up...perceiving what/where {-}

- Perceiving Where
    + Somatotopic maps -- where on skin
    + Kinesthesia -- configuration of limbs
- Perceiving What
    + Patterns of smoothness, roughness, shape, temperature
