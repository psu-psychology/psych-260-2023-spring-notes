### My turn... {-}

- What information do **I** need to acquire? 
- Why do **I** need to know it? In what context & for what purpose?
- What types of information do **I** need to gather, through which channels?

### Dimensions of sensory processing {-}

- *Interoceptive*
    + How am I?
- *Exteroceptive*
    + What's in the world, where is it?
    
#### Questions for interoception: How are you? {-}

- Tired or rested?
- Well or ill?
- Hungry or thirsty or sated?
- Stressed vs. coping?
- Emotional state?
- Where am I?

#### Questions for exteroception {-}

- Who/What is out there?
- Where is it?

### Mrs. Potraz was wrong...there aren't 5 senses {-}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/biopsych-table-8.1.jpg")
```

- More than 5 senses!

#### How sensory channels differ {-}

- What is the energy/chemical source?
- How does the channel inform...
    + What's there?
    + Where's it located or moving?

## Somatosensation {-}

- Sensations about the body

### Types of somatosensation {-}

- Internal (interoceptive)
    + Where/how is my body positioned?  How do I feel?
    + Proprioception (perception of the self)
- External (exteroceptive)
    + What’s in the world?
    + Where is it?

### Internal senses {-}

- Kinesthesia
    + Body position
    + Movement 
- Pain
- Vestibular sense
    + Head position (relative to gravity)
    + Head movement (rotation, translation)
    
#### Vesibulo-ocular response (VOR) {-}

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Vestibulo-ocular response (VOR): https://www.mcgill.ca/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/files/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/images/222_0.gif"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mcgill.ca/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/files/vestibular-gazecontrol-lab/images/222_0.gif")
```

- Keeps eyes steady when head moves

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="[@Castilla2007-cq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_R0LcPnZ_w)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_R0LcPnZ_w")
```

- Can't walk & text without it

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="[@Top_Tens_World2017-gn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynvd70b-uCY)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynvd70b-uCY")
```
    
### External senses {-}

- What's out there and where is it located?
- Cutaneous (receptors in the skin) senses
    + Hot, cold
    + Pressure
    + Vibration
- Plus kinesthesia (why?)

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/cuteneous-receptors.jpg")
```

- Receptors specialize in different info types, properties

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/pacinian-meissner.jpg")
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/merkel-ruffini.jpg")
```

### Combined thermo (heat/cold) and chemo-receptors {-}

- Taste dimension -> chemo receptor ≠ temperature dimension
- Why are minty foods cool?
- Why are spicy foods hot?
- Receptors that sense chemicals AND temperature

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/menthol-vanilloid-receptors.jpg")
```

- Menthol/mint receptor (CMR1)
    + Also signals "cool" temperatures
- Vanilloid Receptors (TrpV1/VR1, VRL1)
    + Respond to capsaicin (in peppers), allyl isothiocyanate (in mustard, wasabi)
    + Also signal "hot" temperatures
    
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Scoville heat scale: https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scoville-Heat-Scale-Savory-Experiments2.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scoville-Heat-Scale-Savory-Experiments2.jpg")
```
    
### Size/speed trade-off {-}

- Not all info travels at the same speed
- Thicker axons -> faster
- Myelinated axons -> faster

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/axon-size-speed-tradeoff.jpg")
```

- Kinesthesia (from muscles and joints) the fastest
- Pain/itch slow

### From skin to brain {-}

- Cutaneous receptors ->
- Dorsal root ganglion in spinal cord ->
- Ventral posterior lateral thalamus ->
- Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) ->
    + Post-central gyrus of parietal lobe
    
#### Dermatomes {-}

- Patches of skin ennervated by a set of nerves

    - Pain, temperature

#### Somatatopic maps in thalamus & cerebral cortex {-}

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/s1.jpg")
```

- Some areas of skin activate disproportionately size areas of the cerebral cortex

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Somatosensory homunculus"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/homunculus.jpg")
```

- Smallest discriminable distance between two-points (two-point threshold) varies

### Somatosensory interoception {-}

#### [Interoception and emotion](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.04.020) {-}

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Figure 1 from [@Critchley2017-km](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.04.020): Fear and neutral faces are time-locked to distinct parts of the cardiac cycle to determine how cardiac afferent signals alter neural activity and intensity judgements (a). A cardiac cycle by emotion interaction demonstrated enhanced bilateral amygdala activation in response to fear faces at systole (b). Fear faces presented at systole were also judged as significantly more intense (c)."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352250X17300106-gr1_lrg.jpg")
```

- Amygdala BOLD activity in response to fearful faces varies by cardiac phase
- Subjective ratings of felt fear vary with cardiac phase

Nummenmaa, L. & Hari, R. (2023). Bodily feelings and aesthetic experience of art. *Cognition & Emotion*, 1–14. https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2023.2183180.

>Humans all around the world are drawn to creating and consuming art due to its capability to evoke emotions, but the mechanisms underlying art-evoked feelings remain poorly characterised. Here we show how embodiement contributes to emotions evoked by a large database of visual art pieces (n = 336). In four experiments, we mapped the subjective feeling space of art-evoked emotions (n = 244), quantified "bodily fingerprints" of these emotions (n = 615), and recorded the subjects' interest annotations (n = 306) and eye movements (n = 21) while viewing the art. We show that art evokes a wide spectrum of feelings, and that the bodily fingerprints triggered by art are central to these feelings, especially in artworks where human figures are salient. Altogether these results support the model that bodily sensations are central to the aesthetic experience.
