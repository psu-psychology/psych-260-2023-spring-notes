Gilmore, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology What is this course about? What is behavior? How is human behavior similar to/different from other animals? What are the neurological bases (of human behavior)? What other bases (of human behavior) are there? How do the neurological bases of human behavior affect your life? Why does taking/drinking X make me feel Y? My grandmother has Alzheimer’s disease. What’s happening to her brain? Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder. What’s that about? Why is sleep so important for brain health? My mom says my frontal cortex isn’t fully mature. Is she right? Is it safe for high school athletes to play football (or soccer, hockey, etc.)? Genes Neurotransmitters Neurons Networks Brains Behavior Keys for success Study the figures. Study regularly – don’t cram. Come to class. Participate! Why is biology essential for the science of behavior? What is science? What distinguishes sciences? What is neuroscience? Why is neuroscience harder than physics? What is science? Body of facts or truths Process of acquiring knowledge Systematic study Observation, experiment, description Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws Strives for objectivity Gilmore on science vs. other ways of thinking Science is a way of thinking and a set of behaviors Science describes, tries to predict Science alone not well-suited to prescribing (recommending) or proscribing (prohibiting) little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc. (Although systematic descriptions of phenomena can be used to make pre/proscriptive claims…) Science rests on evidence and logic NOT on authorities (e.g., people whose stature is largely or solely based on their position or economic status) However, some scientific claims (and scientists) are more credible and authoritative than others. Science respects tradition but questions and tests it repeatedly… Science should be reproducible others can get the same answer Science has led to huge advances in human health and prosperity over the last several centuries will be essential for maintaining and extending those advances in the future Example: Rapid development and deployment of multiple, effective, and safe vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 that sharply reduce severe illness and death. Similarities among sciences What are the different kinds of X? Form, e.g., anatomy How does X work? Function, e.g., physiology Where did X come from? Origins, e.g., development/evolution Examples “Coronavirus gets its name because of its crown-like shape.” “Viruses reproduce (and cause illness) by forcing host organisms to create massive quantities of the virus that then spread to others.” “Coronavirus appears to have originated in non-human animals in China.” Figure 1.1: https://www.evogeneao.com Differences among sciences Phenomena of interest (studying what) Methods or tools (studying it how) At what level(s) of analysis Spatial scale (nanometers \\(10^{-9}m\\) to light-years \\(10^{15}m\\)) Temporal scale (milliseconds \\(10^{-3}s\\) to millenia \\(10^3s\\)) What is neuroscience? The study of the nervous system And the behavior it makes possible Questions neuroscience asks… What are the parts of the nervous system? How do the parts work? What do they do?

The brain has more parts than any other physical entity we know about. B. Physicists have largely ignored biology. C. Nervous systems are influenced by multiple factors we can’t (yet) measure effectively. D. Physicists only study “toy” problems. Systems have all of the following components EXCEPT: A. Boundaries B. Components C. Interactions among components D. Inputs and outputs E. Readily predictable behavior Why study history? What can observation tell us about brain and behavior?

Yes, human minds are fundamentally different from animal minds. The human mind is influenced by both physical and extraphysical processes. No, human minds are similar to animal minds. The human mind arises solely from physical processes. How would you scientifically test Descartes idea about the role of the pineal gland?
